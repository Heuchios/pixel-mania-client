Add flaming_hair item with 4-frame idle animation

- Add flaming_hair atlas frames (icon @12,10; animated hair @13,10-16,10
  in wearable.png) to wearable_atlas.json, same layout pattern as
  frosty_hair one row up.
- Add flaming_hair item to item_database.gd using the hair_animations
  map (same mechanism as frosty_hair/void_visor) so the 4-frame flame
  flicker loops continuously via the idle animation, copied to
  walk/jump/fall by ensure_standard_wearable_animations.
